The effective in effective altruism stems from a desire to do not just good, but the most good that one can. To do this requires being able to both understand the spread of options available as well as have a means to compare and constrast those options. While I believe it is impossible to truly measure the worth of things completely or have a complete catalog of all the options, I still believe that trying to understand the effectiveness of what you are doing - even if incompletely - is a worthy aim as it helps us make better use of our limited time and energy. 

The same, I believe, applies to stewardship. We should be striving not just to be stewards but effective stewards. To do so requires a "bigger picture" a narrative that helps outline the array of options and gives us the tools to quantitively and qualitively compare and constrast them. Obviously creating a complete picture of something as complex as our biosphere is a mission of insanity. But as with many things I expect that the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) applies and we can get 80% of the way there with 20% of the effort. So while we may not be able to create a perfect or complete picture, we can create a pretty damn good one. But even with the Pareto principle in play there's still some scoping to be done to make this approachable. 

1. Given taking informed action requires information I will scope the full space of stewardship down to information and knowledge gathering.
2. I happen to be in New England so we'll shrink the geographic scope down to that.
3. We can scope the whole into pieces on the basis that evaluating actions divides itself into a few pieces: (1) understanding the *value* that our biosphere brings us, (2) understanding where the information is lacking, and (3) understanding how hard it is to get that information. And for (2) there are roughly three kinds of missing information: (a) analogs of value that we haven't explored [for example realizing we don't know what pollinates a specific crop], (b) a lack of maturity in our models of known value [for example not knowing the life cycle of a specific commercially used fish], and (c) the unknown unknowns [like when there's a genus we just don't know anything about at all]. 

So we're going to focus on New England and create ~5 "big pictures" in sequence:
1. What are the known value propositions of New England's ecosystems? How can we measure them relative to one another and how can we organize them?
2. What analogs of value are suggested and how much do we know about those?
3. What models exist of the current value propositions and how mature are they?
4. What unknown unknowns are likely to exist (broadly speaking)?
5. What levels of difficult exist in gathering information/building knowledge and how do they relate back to the gaps outlined above?

And because these things constantly change, we're going to create a living document. One that refers to all the data that has been collected, and makes the conclusions dynamic where it can. One that uses visuals (which can change easily) rather than prose (which can't) and is organized as a web or hierarchy rather than as a series of pages because information of this kind is never linear. 

This is Paideia.
